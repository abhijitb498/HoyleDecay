1. Download the package and unzip it.

2. Open a terminal window inside the unzipped folder and run the install.sh service by typing "sh install.sh"

3. Execute the program DSDH by typing "./DSDH" . 

4. If error is shown then first compile by typing in the terminal "gfortran -o DSDH 12C_12C_DD.f90"

5. Inputs are, i) Number of desired events, ii) Min and Max polar and azimuthal angle of the detector for detecting scattered 12C.
 
6. Any modification needed can be done in the "12C_12C_DD.f90" program and then recompiling again. FORTRAN Compiler "gfortran" is reccommended.
